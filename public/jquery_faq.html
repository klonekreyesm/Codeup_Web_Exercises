    <div><h3>Acadia National Park</h3><button id="preview">preview</button></div>
    
    <ul class="nationalpark" id="acadia-park">
        <li>The average stay is is 3-4 days but, if you plan on exploring the surrounding villages or the Schoodic Peninsula section of Acadia National Park, it can be longer.</li>
        <li>Weekly passes are $20 per vehicle. See Entrance Fees for details and other passes. You can purchase passes at information centers throughout the park.</li>
        <li>There are many miles of shoreline to explore, 125 miles of hiking trails, and 45 miles of carriage roads. Kayaking and canoeing are popular activities. Two beaches offer salt water or fresh water in which to swim. A variety of ranger-led programs will introduce you to Acadia's diverse natural and cultural history. To review and select activities in the surrounding areas, select Activities.</li>
        <li>There are 45 miles of carriage roads open to bikers and walkers. The Park Loop Road is also open to bikers, but there is no shoulder on the road. Biking the Park Loop Road is not advised during the busy part of the day (approximately. 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.). You must bike with the traffic flow on the one-way section of the Park Loop Road. Bikes can be rented in nearby towns.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Badlands National Park</h3>
    <ul class="nationalpark" id="badlands-park">
        <li>All of our trails are spectacular. You really can't go wrong! For a 1.5 mile moderate to strenuous trail, try the Notch Trail. For a longer more moderate hike try any section of the Castle Trail. Be sure to wear sturdy shoes and be prepared for current and predicted weather conditions</li>
        <li>The Saber Site fossil quarry will open in June 2012. Visitors can watch paleontologists working at the site from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, 7 days a week. The site is at the Ben Reifel Visitor Center.</li>
        <li>It is approximately 100 miles (or about 2 hours) from the Ben Reifel Visitor Center to Mount Rushmore. If you enter the park at I-90 exit 131, you should travel west on the Highway 240 Badlands Loop Road. You can choose to exit the park at the Pinnacles Entrance and return to I-90 at exit 110. Alternatively, for a more scenic route, you can travel the Sage Creek Rim Road to Highway 44. The Sage Creek Rim Road route would add about 25 miles, or 45 minutes, to your travel time.</li>
        <li>The Cedar Pass Lodge dates back to 1928 when Ben Millard and his sister Clara opened the Cedar Pass Camp to provide services to tourists braving the area's dusty, undeveloped roads. The Camp once consisted of a grocery store, gas station, dance hall, and cabins. It remains an oasis for travelers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Carlsbad National Park</h3>
    <ul class="nationalpark" id="carlsbad-park">
        <li>The turn off to enter the park is at White's City, along US Highway 62/180, about 20 miles south of Carlsbad and 142 miles northeast of El Paso. The park entrance road starts at White's City and continues 7 miles to the visitor center. Sections of the park road are steep, narrow, and winding.</li>
        <li>Several guided tours are offered and reservations are required. For advanced reservations, call 877-444-6777 or visit www.recreation.gov. Guided tours range in difficulty from walking on paved trails to walking rough dirt trails to crawling through narrow cave passages. Consult the park newspaper, website, or a ranger for more information regarding difficulty and required equipment.</li>
        <li>Enter and exit the cave by elevator and walk the Big Room self-guided tour. To learn more as you walk, rent the audio guide</li>
        <li>Carlsbad Cavern is 56°F (13°C) year round, so a light jacket or long-sleeved shirt is recommended. The trails and cave features are electrically lit, but bring a flashlight if you like. The cave is very humid, bring your inhaler if you use one. The trails are steep, so wear sturdy, closed-toe shoes.
        </li>
